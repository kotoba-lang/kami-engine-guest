  "Portable f32 bit-pattern <-> i64 conversions and UTF-8 byte encoding.

  `kami-engine-clj`'s all-i64 ABI stores every f32 value as its IEEE-754
  bit-pattern zero-extended into an i64 (see `ast.rs`'s module docstring).
  Rust gets this for free from `f32::to_bits`/`f32::from_bits` plus an
  `as i64` cast that zero-extends because the source is unsigned (`u32`).
  These two helpers reproduce exactly that: the JVM/JS numeric primitives
  underneath (`Float/floatToRawIntBits`, `DataView`) are 2's-complement
  32-bit *signed* ints, so both branches explicitly mask to the low 32 bits
  to zero-extend rather than sign-extend.")

;; --- 64-bit integer ops on a 53-bit host -----------------------------------
;;
;; ClojureScript numbers are JS doubles and every JS bitwise operator coerces
;; to 32 bits first. Using `unsigned-bit-shift-right` for an i64 shift is
;; therefore wrong the moment a value exceeds 2^32 — and it fails QUIETLY, by
;; returning the low half. The guest packs a string handle as
;; `(ptr << 32) | len`, so on that path every pointer decoded to the length
;; and every tag read back as NUL bytes. Nothing raised.
;;
;; These do the arithmetic instead of the bit twiddling. The JVM branch keeps
;; using real longs.
;;
;; Limit: a double holds integers exactly only to 2^53, so an i64 above that
;; is approximate here. That is a property of the ClojureScript runtime the
;; browser path already has, not something introduced here; the guest's own
;; values (pointers, entity ids, f32 bit patterns) stay far below it.

;; NOT `(mod x TWO64)`. ClojureScript's `mod` is `js-mod(js-mod(n,d)+d, d)`,
;; and with d = 2^64 the `+ d` loses every low bit of a small n to double
;; precision: `(mod 12 18446744073709551616)` is 0, and
;; `(mod 4398046511110 ...)` drops its trailing 6. It rounds toward a wrong
