(ns kotoba.engine-clj.parity-test
  "Ported from `kami-engine-clj`'s Rust `tests/parity.rs` (deleted,
  uncommitted, recovered from `kami-engine` git history at HEAD
  `kami-engine-clj/tests/parity.rs`, clj-wgsl migration ADR-2607010930).

  ## Honest scope of this port (read before trusting the name \"parity\")

  The Rust original ran the SAME compiled `.wasm` bytes under two
  independent execution engines — wasmtime (a JIT) and wasmi (a bytecode
  interpreter) — and asserted they computed bit-identical i64 results. That
  is a genuine two-backend dispatch-strategy parity check.

  `kotoba.engine-clj.codegen/compile` in this port stops at a Module IR
  (data), not `.wasm` bytes (see that namespace's docstring), so there is no
  wasmtime/wasmi to hand it to — only `kotoba.engine-clj.interp`, ONE
  reference stack-machine interpreter (see its docstring's \"Honest scope\"
  section for the same caveat, repeated there because it matters).

  What this namespace actually proves, on the exact expression list carried
  over from `parity.rs` (chosen there specifically to stress the
  JIT/interpreter boundary — signed division/remainder, negatives, the
  multi-arg comparison chains, control flow, guest f32 math): (1) every
  compile+execute is DETERMINISTIC — running the same source twice through
  independent compile + instantiate + call-export cycles agrees bit-for-bit
  (the property this port's single interpreter CAN prove); and (2) each
  expression computes its mathematically correct value (the property the
  original two-backend check was implicitly also relying on, since both
  backends were expected to be *right*, not just *consistent*).

  ## Known reader gap: `/f`

  See `exec-test`'s namespace docstring \"Known reader gap\" — the JVM
  convenience reader backing `ast/parse-program-str` cannot tokenize the
  bare symbol `/f` from source text (`clojure.edn`/`clojure.core` treat a
  leading `/` as the namespace separator). `f32-division-agrees-and-is-
  correct` below exercises it via `ast/parse-program` on a programmatically
  built form instead, the same workaround `exec-test` uses."
