(ns kotoba.engine-clj.wasm-bytes-test
  "Tests for `kotoba.engine-clj.wasm-bytes` — the Module-IR -> real `.wasm`
  byte-emission step `kotoba.engine-clj.codegen`'s and this repo's README's
  \"Where this port draws the line\" section describe as out of scope for the
  domain port. `basic_test.cljc`'s own docstring notes the original deleted
  Rust test asserted `wasm.starts_with(b\"\\0asm\")` and that this port
  couldn't restore that assertion because it stopped at Module IR — this
  file is what restores it, now that `wasm-bytes` closes that gap.

  ## Manual external verification (not run here — keeps this suite pure
  CLJC/no-I/O, matching this repo's existing convention)

  Beyond what these tests assert structurally, the emitted bytes for both a
  minimal hand-written example and isekai-network's real
  `games/01-netsurvivors/logic.clj` were independently verified with
  external tools during development:
    - `wasm-tools validate <file>.wasm` — exit 0 (structurally valid core
      WASM per the `wasm-tools` project's independent validator, not just
      self-consistent with this encoder's own opcode table).
    - `wasmtime run --invoke add1 minimal.wasm 5` — printed `6`, i.e. the
      minimal example's compiled+encoded `add1` function was actually
      instantiated and *executed* by wasmtime and returned the correct
      value, the strongest verification short of running the isekai-network
      game itself (which needs `kami-script-runtime`'s host-import
      implementations, out of scope here — this repo only emits the guest
      module)."
