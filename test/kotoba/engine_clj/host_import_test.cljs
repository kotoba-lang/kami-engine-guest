;; Before this, `invoke` threw on every `:host-import` ("no ported test
;; exercises host calls"), so the interpreter could execute only the toy
;; modules the ported tests used. Every real game script calls into
;; `kami:engine@1.0.0`, so the interpreter could not run one — which also
;; meant there was no oracle to check a second backend against.
